For the second time in two years, a captive snake in south-east Missouri has given birth without any interaction with a member of the opposite sex.  Officials at the Missouri department of conservation's Cape Girardeau Conservation Nature Center say a female yellow-bellied water snake reproduced on her own in 2014 and again this summer.  The snake has been living in captivity, without a male companion, for nearly eight years.  It occurs in some insects, fish, amphibians, birds and reptiles, including some snakes, but not mammals.  Robert Powell, a biology professor and snake expert at Avila University in Kansas City, said the Brahminy blind snake -- a small burrowing animal native to southeast Asia commonly known as the flowerpot snake -- has long been the only known snake that routinely reproduces without a male's contribution.  But Michelle Randecker, a naturalist at the center, said eight years is too long.  `` If nothing else, it's an interesting phenomena.  Just another sign that nature works in mysterious ways .  `` You learn things about what they're capable of .
