After Hungary shut its southern border a week ago, refugees swerved west through Croatia, and for several days Croatian police let tens of thousands enter through this crossing point.  They were then allowed to wait at the first train station across the border.  `` At the back end you have the Serbian police, and at the front end you have the Croatian police,'' said Twaij by telephone.  Police didn't want it to become another refugee camp so they haven't allowed tents to go up .  A spokeswoman for Médecins Sans Frontières, which also has a doctor on the ground, said the logjam occurred because there is not enough space at a newly opened refugee camp over the border.  Sophie-Jane Madden said on Tuesday: `` About8,000 people crossed yesterday from Serbia to Croatia.  Nearly500,000 people, mainly fleeing wars in Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, have reached European shores by sea this year.  Despite their best efforts no government has been able to stop their onwards march towards northern Europe.  But many countries are wary of agreeing to any deal, leading the UN to warn that the continent's unity is at risk.  Though it has ultimately allowed refugees to continue to cross its territory, Hungary's parliament on Monday enacted new legislation that grants officials the power to use rubber bullets against refugees, and to search private residences thought to be sheltering undocumented foreigners.
