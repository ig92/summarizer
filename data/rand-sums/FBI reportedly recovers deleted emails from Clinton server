The initial report, which cited a source familiar with the FBI investigation into Clinton's private email server, was corroborated by The New York Times, which cited two government officials.  It was not immediately clear whether all30,000 messages Clinton said she had deleted from the server had been recovered, but one official told the Times that it had not been difficult to recover the emails that had been found so far.  The FBI is investigating whether classified information that passed through Clinton's so-called `` homebrew'' server during her time as secretary of state was mishandled.  Clinton turned over approximately30,000 copies of messages she deemed work-related to the State Department this past December.  Clinton said earlier this year that the emails she deleted from the private server she kept at her Chappaqua, N.Y., home mostly pertained to personal matters such as her daughter Chelsea's wedding and the secretary's yoga routines.  There are different standards to scrub when you do it for government versus commercial .  It is not known when exactly Mrs. Clinton `` wiped'' her server, nor who was directed to do so.  A separate source, who also was not authorized to speak on the record, said the FBI will further determine whether Clinton should have known, based on the quality and detail of the material, that emails passing through her server contained classified information regardless of the markings.
