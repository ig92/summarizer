Lufthansa will offer Wi-Fi on its short - and medium-haul flights from 2017, provided by the satellite firm Inmarsat and Deutsche Telekom.  One European airline, Norwegian, offers free Wi-Fi aboard its planes.  Lufthansa is to start rolling out broadband internet access to passengers on its planes from next year using existing satellite connectivity, but Carsten Spohr, the airline's chief executive, said they were thinking further ahead: `` We want to engage in the development of next-generation technology.  `` The provision of reliable, consistent broadband connectivity aboard our planes, which will match that of high-speed home broadband in terms of speed and quality, is of extreme importance to us .  However, the prospect of high-speed internet access to facilitate communication in the sky has not been universally welcomed.  Its Accountability Office said that would-be attackers could exploit new vulnerabilities: `` This interconnectedness can potentially provide unauthorised remote access to aircraft avionics systems .
