Britain can produce 85 % of its power via renewable energy by 2030 provided it undergoes significant changes in energy production and use, according to a new study by Greenpeace.  The study attempts to counter the argument that only fossil fuels and nuclear power can keep the lights on for the next few decades.  However, the renewables drive would need to be accompanied by a 60 % reduction in demand for domestic heating through a home insulation programme and other initiatives, according to the report by energy system analysts, Demand Energy Equality.  The plan, which would require a major change in government policies, envisages fossil fuels playing a role via combined gas-fired heat and power projects.  Many homes and buildings would also need to move away from gas-fired boilers to their own ground source heat pumps or an electricity source.  The feasability of decarbonising the UK's power generation system, which was dependent for a long time on carbon-heavy coal, has long been argued over.  The new analysis shows a low-carbon energy sector is possible but only if our relationship with energy changes at the national, household and personal level.  The cost of the transformation programme is not spelled out, but the Greenpeace report notes that a similar study done in 2011 by Poyry consultants for the parliamentary climate change committee produced a price tag of between # 126bn and # 227bn to achieve 65 % renewable penetration by 2030.  `` This is a useful report dealing with the complex issue of absorbing high penetrations of renewable power generation in line with achieving challenging reductions in carbon emissions,'' he said.  This makes a huge difference in mobilising capital and undertaking the work necessary.  The Greenpeace study has ruled out nuclear because of the financial and environmental cost of building new plants, such as Hinkley Point C, and dealing with the legacy of their waste.
