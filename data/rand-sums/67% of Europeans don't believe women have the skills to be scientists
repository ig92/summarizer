If you ask a kid to draw a scientist, they will draw a `` mad scientist'' with sticking up hair in a white lab coat, probably holding a test tube containing some evil-looking smoking liquid: an amalgam of Einstein and Frankenstein.  The Lâ€™Oreal Foundation have just published the results of a survey they carried out across Europe, asking around 5000 people their views and perceptions of scientists.  The answers shocked me.  With this level of incredulity about women being capable of doing science, we shouldn't be astonished that the speed of women rising to the top of the profession is as glacially slow as it is.  When asked what impeded women's rise to the top, both men and women said cultural factors were important.  Despite all the negative connotations around women in science, those questioned actually thought there were more of us female scientists out there than there really are.  They estimated that women hold 28 % of the highest academic functions within scientific fields across the European Union.  The reality.  There are around 11 % women at the top.  Collectively Jo -LRB- e -RRB- Public just doesn't seem to have much faith that women can and should be scientists.  Only when gender becomes irrelevant to how people view the person at the bench will equality in the lab even start to be a reality.
