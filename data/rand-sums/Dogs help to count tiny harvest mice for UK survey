The canine will be trained to detect the scent of harvest mice to help better count the elusive small mammal in the British countryside.  The sniffer dog project, based at Moulton College, Northamptonshire, is being funded by the People's Trust for Endangered Species -LRB- PTES -RRB- after encouraging results using trained dogs to seek out the little spotted kiwi in New Zealand.  There, two English setters managed to detect 30 secretive kiwi birds, including 10 little spotted kiwis, in just four days.  Harvest mice are typically counted by researchers seeking out their woven nests, hidden among tall grasses or reeds, but Howard-Williams is investigating innovative alternatives.  `` I'm very pleased with her progress -- amazed, actually .  Sniffer dogs have also been used to help scientists locate bumblebee nests -- with mixed results, as Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, revealed in A Sting in the Tale.
