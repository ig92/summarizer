Contradictory accounts have emerged over the fatal shooting of an 18-year-old Palestinian student, Hadeel al-Hashlamon, by Israeli forces at a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron on Tuesday morning, after she allegedly pulled a knife on the soldiers.  `` From the preliminary review regarding this morning's incident in Hebron, the perpetrator approached the checkpoint and the metal detector was activated, alerting the troops' suspicion,'' the Israel defence forces said in a statement.  `` At this point, forces fired at the ground, then at her lower extremities in attempts to stop her advancement.  However, Palestinian eyewitnesses and foreign activists from a local group called Youth Against Settlements have contradicted that story.  `` She had just come through the metal detector at the checkpoint,'' Amro said.  `` You see the soldier wearing the kippa hold up his hand.  He is telling others at the checkpoint not to enter .  Hashlamon is seen both facing the Palestinian man, who has spoken to her, and turning to face the soldier with the radio.  `` The attacker attempted to stab a soldier,'' an Israeli army spokeswoman told al-Jazeera, explaining that the unidentified soldier -- who was not injured -- then opened fire.  The next images show Hashlamon on the ground, her jeans visible and a blood stain on one hip.  Another point at which the two accounts diverge is in the claim that Hashlamon was given immediate medical treatment.  Instead video that appears to have been taken at the scene shows what seems to be the injured student being pulled roughly by her legs by a soldier from under the barrier where she had fallen.
