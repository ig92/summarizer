Barack Obama's British cousin is suing the Metropolitan police for #400,000, claiming she was subjected to a campaign of bullying and humiliation.  Marie Auma, of Palmers Green in north London, said officers and employees pursued a conspiracy against her, including two who deliberately broke wind beside her desk at Southwark police station.  Auma, 57, who was at the US president's inauguration in 2009, claims she was belittled and humiliated by some colleagues when she worked as a civilian in the telephone investigations bureau.  Mensah said few of the individual incidents that occurred between 2007 and 2009 could be said to be harassment, but together formed a culture of `` overzealous, oppressive managing'' of Auma, where she was forced to take `` inappropriate breaks'' making it impossible for her to meet her targets.  `` Most of the behaviour was open,'' said Mensah.  `` The passing of wind at her desk in an open plan office is an attempt to belittle her and humiliate her .  She added: `` There was clear evidence before the defendants that she was suffering stress, causing her ill health, and she attributed that to the bullying and harassment that she complained of .
