`` And Putin said he knows how popular a performer Elton John is.  If in the future their schedules allow, he's ready to meet with him and discuss any questions that interest him .  The tumultuous story of John and Putin began after the singer said in an Instagram post earlier this month that the president had called him and he looked forward to meeting Putin `` face-to-face to discuss LGBT equality in Russia''.  That's when Vladimir `` Vovan'' Krasnov and Alexei `` Lexus'' Stolyarov, a pair of hoaxers known for their prank calls to Russian and Ukrainian celebrities, admitted they had been the ones who phoned John.  The embarrassing incident has now apparently been smoothed out with Putin's call.  The news of Putin's potential meeting with John nearly overshadowed the announcement on Thursday that he would meet the US president, Barack Obama, at the UN next week.  Putin signed a law in 2013 that banned the `` propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors'', ushering in a wave of harassment and violence against gay people, including teenagers.  John has campaigned for gay rights in Russia and in 2014 published an open letter condemning the gay propaganda law and offering to introduce Putin to members of the LGBT community.  Despite Putin's call to John, the president seems to remain firm in stressing `` traditional values'' over minority rights.
