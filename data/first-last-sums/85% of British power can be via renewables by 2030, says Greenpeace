Britain can produce 85 % of its power via renewable energy by 2030 provided it undergoes significant changes in energy production and use, according to a new study by Greenpeace. The study attempts to counter the argument that only fossil fuels and nuclear power can keep the lights on for the next few decades. It foresees wind leaping from today's level of 13 gigawatts -LRB- GW -RRB- of wind farms in operation -- enough to power around 10 million homes -- to a level of 77GW in 2030, with solar rising from just more than 5GW to 28GW. However, the renewables drive would need to be accompanied by a 60 % reduction in demand for domestic heating through a home insulation programme and other initiatives, according to the report by energy system analysts, Demand Energy Equality. `` For a long time the government and the fossil fuel industry have peddled the argument that renewables can't keep the lights on if the wind's not blowing.
