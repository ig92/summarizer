The Dutch city of Rotterdam has opened the world's first smog-free tower. Co-designed by Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde, the seven-metre high tower sucks in dirty air like a giant vacuum cleaner. Ion technology then filters it, before returning bubbles of smog-free air through the tower's vents. It is able to clean30,000 cubic metres of air an hour, according to Roosegaarde. Clean air is a precious commodity. A new study has found that more than three million people die prematurely due to air pollution each year. This is projected to double by 2050 if the problem isn't tackled. `` The smog-free tower contributes to a debate that shouldn't be confined to politics,'' says Rotterdam's mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. Aboutaleb acknowledges the innovation's limitations: `` It may not be the answer to all our problems, but this shouldn't be the main objective,'' he says.
