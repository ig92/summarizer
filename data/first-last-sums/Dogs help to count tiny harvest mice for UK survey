They are used to detect criminals evading capture, people trapped in buildings and drugs or explosives hidden in luggage. Now conservationists are recruiting the help of a sniffer dog in an effort to survey -- and ultimately protect -- wildlife. The canine will be trained to detect the scent of harvest mice to help better count the elusive small mammal in the British countryside. We are very excited to be funding this project and look forward to seeing what the results reveal about harvest mice populations in the UK .
