Refugees hoping to reach the safety of the EU faced a fresh obstacle on Tuesday morning after Croatian police blocked off part of the country's border with Serbia, which had in recent days become the main entry point to the EU for thousands of people walking north from Greece. More than2,000 refugees were stranded overnight on Monday in no man's land between the Croatian village of Tovarnik and the Serbian town of Å id, medics on the scene told the Guardian, creating another dilemma for European leaders hoping to hammer out a migration strategy in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday. Other refugees were subsequently allowed to cross the border at a second crossing, near the town of Bapska, to the north. But the development at Tovarnik nevertheless marks the first time Croatia has attempted to stop refugees from entering its territory since it became the primary refugee route to northern Europe last week. After Hungary shut its southern border a week ago, refugees swerved west through Croatia, and for several days Croatian police let tens of thousands enter through this crossing point. Europe's leaders are gathering again on Tuesday and Wednesday in another attempt to agree a way of sharing the refugee numbers proportionally among all members of the EU.
